# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a graphical implementation of the classic two-player game, where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. This project is built using Python's Tkinter library, featuring both single-player (against a configurable AI) and two-player modes.

## Features
- **Single-Player Mode:** Play against an AI with adjustable difficulty.
- **Two-Player Mode:** Play with a friend on the same device.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures players can only select empty cells.
- **Game Reset:** Easily reset the game board to play again.
- **Settings:** Configure AI difficulty and theme mode.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The main programming language used for the game logic.
- **Tkinter:** The library used to create the graphical user interface.
